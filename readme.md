# Classic-Snake-Game

A classic snake game built using html,css,javascript and html5 canvas.The crawling speed of snake keeps increaing with time.Various audios are emmited for every change in direction and after game overs.


## Motivation
I wanted to put all my javascript skills and test my problem solving skills in context of development.So, I rebuilt this game using basics of canvas animation and geometry.I have really learnt a lot while building this game on my own.
